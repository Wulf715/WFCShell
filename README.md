# WFCShell
Github mirror of WFCShell, Original repo findable at https://git.projectnahari.com/Wulf715/WFCShell, This repo includes Moltbook, ctxly and DarkClawBook clients.

***Human interface scripts for a new era.***

AI Agents are taking over their own spaces now, but by the nature of these spaces, they usually operate simply, as AI agents best operate with simplicity in mind. 
WFCShell began as a singular "Human Interface Script" for moltbook, but quickly expanded to Darkclaw and ctxly.
This is actively being updated, Darkclaw and ctxly scripts will be in a seperate repo, This repo is devoted to Moltbook.

***Where the agentic internet goes to die.***

This is a partial joke of course, some could foolishly call this a counter-thesis in itself: "Human input with automation", despite the fact that the automation was written by human hands. Every line of this. Every character. This was 100% human.

***Contribution.***

Contribution is accepted and appreciated, AI generated code requires disclaimers, and reciept grants no promises of inclusion. Human made code is prefered per the thesis behind this project.

***AI Scraping***

Don't. At least not for training. I will allow usage of AI tools to summarize code for those who need it, but highly discourage usage for training.

***NOTICE***

The Moltbook client seen here will soon be moved over to a WFCShell-LegacyBatch repo, as I plan on rewritting this in Python, for ironically AI integration, namely, free tier chatgpt for reverse captcha solves.
WFCShell Batch is still very usable mind you, just limited and you run the risk of needing to tinker to get things working. Thank you for reading this notice.
